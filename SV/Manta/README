1. create a list of bamfiles as txt file
2. conda activate manta (which has manta installed from bioconda)
3. run createWorkflows.py, make sure sample name is extracted from the filepath, this is quick, do it on a normal machine
4. this prints out bsub instructions, should look like what is in bsubmaster.sh
5. take that printout and put it in your bsub file
6. bsub < <bsub file>
7. check success: there should be a file called <sampleID>/results/variants/diploidSV.vcf.gz
8. Create summary Stats: see mantaStats.*
8.1. The shell script needs a list of all diploidSV.vcf.gz files
8.2. The python script creates a pandas spreadsheet from the resulting mantaStats.txt

Provide the reference genome like so:
export REFGENOME=/research/btc_bioinformatic/operations/data_masdar/ucsc.hg19.fasta

configManta.py --bam <sample>_001_FR_hg19.paired_aligned_Sorted_Merged_dedup.bam --referenceFasta $REFGENOME --runDir /research/genomicds1/Manta


To execute the workflow, run the following script and set appropriate options:

/research/genomicds1/Manta/runWorkflow.py
This part is computationally expensive, so we run it through bsub, see bsubmaster.sh

./runWorkflow.py
more alignmentStatsSummary.txt
more svCandidateGenerationStats.tsv
zcat candidateSV.vcf.gz | grep MantaINS |wc -l
zcat candidateSV.vcf.gz | grep MantaINS |grep "SVLEN=[0-9][0-9]" |cut -f8 -d$'\t' |cut -d ';' -f 3|wc -l


9. Creation of consensus sv.vcf

python aggregateSVruns.py > sv.vcf
cat header.vcf sv.vcf > sv2.vcf
